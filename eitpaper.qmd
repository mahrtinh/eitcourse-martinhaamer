## Formatted Text Examples

Examples of **bold text** and *italic text*. We can also combine them for ***bold and italic text***.

You can also use: - `inline code` for small code snippets - ~~strikethrough text~~ - [links to websites](https://quarto.org)

## Mathematical Equations

Here's a simple inline equation: $E = mc^2$

And here's a display equation:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## Code Chunks and Analysis

Let's create some simple R code that produces output:

```{r}
#| label: basic-analysis
#| echo: true

# Create some sample data
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# Calculate mean and correlation
mean_x <- mean(x)
mean_y <- mean(y)
correlation <- cor(x, y)

print(paste("Mean of x:", mean_x))
print(paste("Mean of y:", mean_y))
print(paste("Correlation:", correlation))

# Create a simple plot
plot(x, y, main = "Simple Scatter Plot", 
     xlab = "X values", ylab = "Y values", 
     pch = 19, col = "blue")
abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "red")
```
